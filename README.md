## Deploying Standalone VM-Series in vSphere##
Skillet to deploy and bootstrap a standalone VM-Series on vSphere environment. 

The skillet is using VMware terraform provider to automate the deployment of a standalone VM-Series in vSphere environment.
The deployment will include:
- Creating bootstrapping iso file to bootstrap the VM-Series
- Uploading the bootstrapping iso file to the datastore.
- Creating a VM folder in vCenter.
- Creating a VM-Series VM from a base image template.
- Attach the bootstrapping ISO file.
- Power on the VM-Series.

After running the skillet, a standalone VM-Series will be deployed in the vSphere environment. And it will be configured with management configuration and connects to Panorama, if a Panorama Server IP is added as part of the variables.

## prerequisites ##
Before running this skillet you need to create a VM-Series VM template in your vCenter environment.

You can create the VM-Series VM Template using the following steps:

* Step 1.	Download the VM-Series base image ova file from the support portal
https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/

* Step 2.	Deploy the OVA image to vCenter. (DO NOT POWER ON THE VM)
More info can be found at:

* Step 3.	Convert the VM to a Template
Right click on the VM and select Template > Convert to Template

support policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and
Palo Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible.
We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the
components of the project through our normal support options such as
Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers)
partners and backline support options. The underlying product used
(the VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported,
but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in
deploying or using the template or script itself. Unless explicitly tagged,
